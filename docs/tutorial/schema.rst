Schema Overview
---------------

** see 'autoinvent-example' project for demo of how schema is auto-generated from SQLAlchemy field types, backend 'metadata' customization, frontend autoinvent libraries, and front-end customization

(AG) = "Auto-Generated" (by sqlalchemy-to-metajson on the backend); not necessary to change

(AGF) = "Auto-Generated By Frontend" (by 'conveyor-redux', 'magql-query', or other front-end library; merged with backend schema)

(R) = "Required" to specify in backend 'metadata' otherwise app won't run

(C) = "Customize"; usually needs to be customized or specified in some way => needs attention upon startup

(O) = "Optional"; usually not important to customize, or has a default that is the preferred behavior => does not need attention upon startup

(DEF) = "Default"; usually does not need to be changed; has a default display value (derived from modelName/fieldName); (default created by conveyor-schema)
